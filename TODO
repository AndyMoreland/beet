* refactor methods in bin/beet to use each other (lots of duplication between generate and just_recipe
* refactor so you can use template names in the recipe calls along with local paths and remote paths

* fixup places where its obviously just rails stuff, like add_gems
* generate command in bin/beet should have executor stuff pulled out of case, ie, it should always run
* create a better way to mixin things from rails/whatever as needed inside Beet::Executor
